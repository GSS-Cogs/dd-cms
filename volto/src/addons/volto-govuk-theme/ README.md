# volto-govuk-theme

Uses the [customization system](https://docs.voltocms.com/recipes/customizing-components/) in volto to implement a govuk
themed public layout.

Not yet ready to be separated into its own git repo and packaged; needs to at least depend on `surevine/govuk-react-jsx`,
but that in turn isn't yet feasible due to the comments in [#49](https://github.com/GSS-Cogs/dd-cms/issues/49)
